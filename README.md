This project was started as Personal Portfolio to showcase my skills as a Web Developer. It was initially developed as a part of Pesto Tech's 1st month's curriculum. Learned a lot in 3 months of [Pesto Tech's Career Accelerator Program](http://web.archive.org/web/20190606070237/https://pesto.tech/) became a life long learner. :)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
